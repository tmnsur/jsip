/**
 * A ContentEncodingHeader is used as a modifier to the "media-type". When
 * present, its value indicates what additional content codings have been
 * applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied
 * in order to obtain the media-type referenced by the ContentTypeHeader. The
 * ContentEncodingHeader is primarily used to allow a body to be compressed
 * without losing the identity of its underlying media type.
 * <p>
 * If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the ContentEncodings
 * must be listed in the order in which they were applied. All content-coding
 * values are case-insensitive. Clients MAY apply content encodings to the body
 * in requests. A server MAY apply content encodings to the bodies in responses.
 * The server MUST only use encodings listed in the Accept-Encoding header field
 * in the request. If the server is not capable of decoding the body, or does
 * not recognize any of the content-coding values, it must send a
 * UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE Response, listing acceptable encodings in an
 * AcceptEncodingHeader.
