 * This interface represents the AllowEvents SIP header, as defined by
 * <a href = "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3265.txt">RFC3265</a>, this header is
 * not part of RFC3261.
 * <p>
 * The AllowEventsHeader includes a list of tokens which indicates the event
 * packages supported by the client (if sent in a request) or server (if sent in
 * a response). In other words, a node sending an AllowEventsHeader is
 * advertising that it can process SUBSCRIBE requests and generate NOTIFY
 * requests for all of the event packages listed in that header.
 * <p>
 * Any node implementing one or more event packages SHOULD include an
 * appropriate AllowEventsHeader indicating all supported events in all methods
 * which initiate dialogs and their responses (such as INVITE) and OPTIONS
 * responses. This information is very useful, for example, in allowing user
 * agents to render particular interface elements appropriately according to
 * whether the events required to implement the features they represent are
 * supported by the appropriate nodes.
 * <p>
 * Note that "Allow-Events" headers MUST NOT be inserted by proxies.
