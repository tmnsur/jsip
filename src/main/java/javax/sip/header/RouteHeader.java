 * The Route header field is used to force routing for a request through the

 * Request to the host listed in that entry using it as the RequestURI.
 * <p>
 * Explicit Route assignment (if needed) for the initial dialog establishment is
 * the applications responsibility, but once established Routes are maintained
 * by the dialog layer and should not be manupulated by the application. For
 * example the SipProvider queries the dialog for Route assignment and adds
 * these to the outgoing message as needed. The {@link javax.sip.address.Router}
 * may be used by the application to determine the initial Route of the message.
